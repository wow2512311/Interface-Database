# Interface-Database
 The wavefunction, as the basic hypothesis of quantum mechanics, describes the motion of particles and plays a pivotal role in determining physical properties. We construct two kinds of interfaces as our feature dataset for the visualization of wavefunction . One is an interface connected by wide and narrow segments, the other is porous GNR.
